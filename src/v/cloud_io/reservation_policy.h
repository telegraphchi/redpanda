/// by `reserved_available` inside `reservation_group_state`) or the
/// common pool (`_shared`, below). Reservations ebb and flow with
/// demand: refill builds a group's reservation back up toward
/// `target_reserved` while the group is active; the policy reclaims
/// idle reservations to the common pool after the dwell window. See
/// `reservation_group_state` for the mechanism details.
